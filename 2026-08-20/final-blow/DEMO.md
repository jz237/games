# Watch Demo / Attract Mode

Final Blow 1.0E can run a complete CPU-vs-CPU exhibition from the title screen.

## Player experience

- `WATCH DEMO · CPU VS CPU` starts immediately.
- Both sides use the same delayed-observation, archetype-aware `Pro` AI available to normal play.
- Each exhibition is a normal best-of-three match: the timer, rounds, Grit, enhanced attacks, supers, knockouts, and character-specific Final Blows are unchanged.
- The director alternates a full-Grit showcase side and briefly brings both CPUs into range, guaranteeing one opening super before normal archetype AI takes over.
- Results remain on screen for five seconds before the next exhibition begins.
- Keyboard, pointer/touch, or gamepad input exits to the title immediately.
- `IDLE WATCH DEMO · 45 SECONDS` in Options enables or disables automatic attract mode. It is enabled by default and never tries to bypass browser audio-autoplay rules.

## Nonrepeating director

`engine/demo.mjs` uses deterministic shuffle bags:

- all 28 unordered eight-fighter matchups play before a matchup repeats;
- fighters are randomly assigned to the left or right side;
- every stage and all four soundtracks are exhausted before their bags refill;
- bag boundaries are repaired so the previous matchup, stage, or soundtrack cannot repeat immediately.

The director retains only the current bounded bags, so it does not accumulate match history during long unattended runs.

## Coverage choreography (2.9 FLOW)

`engine/demo-choreo.mjs` layers a deterministic choreographer over the two
demo CPUs so every exhibition works through the featured pair's entire kit
instead of whatever the archetype tables happen to roll:

- Per-fighter checklist: all punch/kick normals (standing, crouching, air),
  the forward command normals and overhead, every special, every EX version,
  the super, the grab, the personal throwable (base + EX) — plus staged beats:
  wall splat, juggle, counter-hit, dizzy, knockdown/wake-up, guarded contact,
  taunt, both dashes, all three jump arcs and the stage-weapon pickup where
  the stage plans one.
- Selection biases strongly toward the least-shown item, with a 60/40 blend
  against untouched Pro-AI windows so it still reads as a fight. Situational
  beats are staged opportunistically (downed opponent → taunt, grounded
  weapon → pickup, cornered opponent → wall splat, meter → super/EX).
- The AI brain still observes every tick; a scripted directive merely outranks
  its input. Fully deterministic: a private rng seeded from the demo cycle,
  no `Math.random`, `state.rng` untouched, and no leaks into ranked/vs CPU
  behaviour (everything is scoped to `state.mode === "demo"`).
- `window.__finalBlowQa.demoCoverage()` returns the live ledger: featured
  pair/stage, per-fighter move counts, beat counts and the matchup keys the
  session has already featured.

## Verification

- `node --test tests/demo.test.mjs` checks determinism, full matchup coverage, stage/track rotation, boundary behavior, invalid configuration, and 10,000 bounded cycles.
- `node --test tests/demo-coverage.test.mjs` runs the choreographer against a
  sim-lite world (`tests/demo-mock-world.mjs`) and asserts 100% kit-move
  coverage plus every staged beat for the featured pair inside a bounded run,
  checklist completeness for all ten fighters, deterministic replay of the
  ledger, and the ten-fighter/six-stage rotation property.
- `node tests/browser-smoke.mjs` checks two live AI brains, automatic Final Blow activation, result scheduling, 64 rapid cycles with one bounded intro timer, input-to-exit, mobile HUD bounds, hidden touch controls, and offline precaching.
